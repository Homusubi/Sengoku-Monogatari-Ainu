Kotan

A kotan is, simply put, a traditional Ainu village (well, more like a hamlet really, as there were rarely more than ten households in each one). The Ainu did not settle proper cities, as most of their food came from hunting and gathering; rather, they stuck to kotan, and invented a system of designated hunting grounds and the like in order to prevent the usual problems faced by non-nomadic hunter-gatherer cultures. 

Ainu Civilisation




Anyway, the Ainu lived relatively peacefully for the next few centuries, as successive Japanese emperors and shogun had more important things to worry about than the island to their north, which they called Ezochi.

The first threat to Ainu rule over Aynu Mosir came in the 1400s, when the Kakizaki (later Matsumae) samurai clan from the mainland built a castle in the far south of Ezochi, and started to build their wealth on incursions into this new land and on trading with the Ainu. Even at this early stage, the Ainu of southern Ezochi sometimes ended up in armed conflict with the Matsumae, most notably in the Koshamain War of the 1450s, which the Wajin eventually won through importing troops from the mainland.









Almost none.





While other civs are likely to view forests as obstacles to district production, the Ainu are encouraged to settle close to them while leaving them untouched. Strategic placement of Kotan for housing and the food bonuses to go with it can lead to a strong foundation for Samkusaynu to pursue less peaceful goals with his Great Generals and the army to go with them.


As mentioned before, the Ainu thrive when near forests and mountains. Not only do they make the Kotan significant, but they allow the Ainu to defend against early attacks through the use of Surku Archers. As the game progresses, a Samkusaynu-led Ainu civilisation has the option of going on the attack, due to the frequent general spawns with added reinforcements. Alternatively, the Ainu can stick to defending their forests and pursue whatever kind of victory they are collecting Kamuy Yukar Great Person bonuses for.
